## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It combines anomaly detection and classification to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Project Statement
Detect fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses for businesses.

## Description
Fraudulent transactions can cost businesses millions. With Python and Scikit-learn, you'll develop a credit card fraud detection system. This project combines anomaly detection and classification to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a highly imbalanced credit card transaction dataset with the following attributes:

- **Time**: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1-V28**: Principal components obtained with PCA.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: Target variable (0 for non-fraud, 1 for fraud).

## Approach
### Data Preprocessing
1. Load the dataset.
2. Separate features and target variable.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Scale the features using `StandardScaler`.
5. Handle class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

### Model Training
1. **Anomaly Detection**: 
   - Train an Isolation Forest to identify anomalies.
2. **Classification**: 
   - Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the anomalies detected by the Isolation Forest.

### Combined Prediction
1. Use the Isolation Forest to identify potential fraud cases (anomalies).
2. Apply the Logistic Regression model to the identified anomalies to classify them as fraud or non-fraud.

## Evaluation
### Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Correctness of the positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability of the model to identify positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### Results
- **Accuracy**: 99.51%
- **Precision**: 23.92%
- **Recall**: 84.69%
- **F1 Score**: 37.30%

### Visualization
Confusion matrix visualization provides a clear understanding of the model's performance.
